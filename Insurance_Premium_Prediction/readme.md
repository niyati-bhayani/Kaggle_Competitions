This repository contains SQL queries and insights derived from the Kaggle competition **[Playground Series Season 4, Episode 12](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e12)**. The goal was to analyze the dataset, uncover key insights, and generate actionable results.  

## Highlights  

### SQL Techniques Used  
- **Data Exploration**: Explored data distributions and relationships using basic SQL SELECT and aggregation.  

- **Joins and CTEs**: Utilized JOINs and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to handle complex multi-table relationships.  

- **Date Functions**: Extracted insights based on temporal patterns.  

- **Subqueries**: Performed nested queries for filtering and transformation.

  
## Future Enhancements  
- Integrate visualizations using Python libraries like Matplotlib or Tableau.  

- Automate data loading and query execution for seamless analysis.  

- Extend analysis with additional datasets for deeper insights.
